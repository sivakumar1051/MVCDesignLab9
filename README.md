#PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Project Description
Task Management System
The Task Management System is a simple Java-based web application developed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. 
It allows US to add, view, and delete tasks. Each task has a unique ID incremented automatically, a description, 
and a status (Pending or Completed).
 It has following structure :

Model: Handles data storage for tasks and provides methods for adding, retrieving, and deleting tasks using the simple ArrayList
View: JSP pages (taskList.jsp and addTask.jsp) display tasks and forms for adding new tasks.
Controller: A servlet (TaskController) manages requests, processes actions (add and delete), and controls navigation between views.
Add Task: Users can add a new task by entering a description and selecting a status. After adding, the task list is updated to include the new task.
View Tasks: The main view displays all tasks in a table format, with options to delete each task.
Delete Task: Users can delete a task from the list by clicking the Delete button next to it. This action updates the task list view.
